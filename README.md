Pandemic Code Red

Online multiplayer version of the cooperative board game Pandemic.

Built by Andrew Smith, Robin Lee, David Boicourt, and Jim Santos as the capstone project for Fullstack Cohort 1810.

The goal of Pandemic Code Red is to assume the role of a disease response team and work together to cure four pathogens currently threatening humanity. Each player has four actions a turn and may move from city to city and treat diseases as they go. At the end of the turn each player draws two city cards, of which 5 of a single color are needed to cure that disease. But move quickly, as more cities become infected each turn. If all 4 diseases are cured, you've won! But if all player cards are exhausted or any virus becomes impossible to contain humanity is doomed!
